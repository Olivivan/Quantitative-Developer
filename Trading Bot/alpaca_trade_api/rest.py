"""DEPRECATED: Alpaca REST client removed from active codebase.

This module used to contain the Alpaca REST client implementation. The
repository has migrated to Binance; the original Alpaca files have been
archived under `Trading Bot/legacy_alpaca/`.

Importing or using this module will raise ImportError so leftover references
are obvious and fail fast.
